# Enhancing Optical Imaging for Crop Science.
# 2D Simulation Code.
This is a 2D simulation of a 3D device, used to study bioflourescence in leaves. The initial geometry is shown below.

Photons emit from the LED, following a sinusoidal probability distribution, and reflect of various surfaces until they are absorbed by the leaf. The points on the x axis where the photons are absorbed are recorded and outputted. 

The purpose of this is to study the uniformity of illumination.

This version is very basic as we are at the beginning of our project.
